            <p>Vivekananda (born January 12, 1863, Calcutta [now Kolkata]—died July 4, 1902, near Calcutta) Hindu spiritual leader and reformer in India who attempted to combine Indian spirituality with Western material progress, maintaining that the two supplemented and complemented one another. His Absolute was a person’s own higher self; to labour for the benefit of humanity was the noblest endeavour.</p>
            <p>
              Born into an upper-middle-class family of the Kayastha (scribes) caste in Bengal, he was educated at a Western-style university where he was exposed to Western philosophy, Christianity, and science. Social reform became a prominent element of Vivekananda’s thought, and he joined the Brahmo Samaj (Society of Brahma), dedicated to eliminating child marriage and illiteracy and determined to spread education among women and the lower castes. He later became the most-notable disciple of Ramakrishna, who demonstrated the essential unity of all religions.

            <p>Swami Vivekananda is someone who needs no introduction. An eminent figure, he is recognised for shedding light on Hinduism for the West. He spoke for Hinduism in the 1893 Chicago Parliament of Religions, catapulting an obscure Indian monk into the spotlight. On January 12th, we celebrate National Youth Day in honour of Swami Vivekananda’s birthday.</p>
            <p>Swami Vivekananda established the Ramakrishna Mission on May 1st, 1897, with the dual goals of individual salvation and global betterment. The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda collects his many works, including his lectures, essays, correspondence, and poetry. He never makes his lessons about himself and instead emphasises overarching ideas that apply to everyone. He was bright. His one-of-a-kind insights and perspectives never fail to reawaken and enliven us. A guru and a reformer, he left a lasting impression on society.</p>

            <h2>Meeting with Ramakrishna Paramahamsa</h2>
            <p>One of the turning points in Swami Vivekananda’s life was his meeting with the revered saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Under Ramakrishna’s guidance, Narendranath (later known as Swami Vivekananda) delved into profound spiritual experiences and explored the essence of different religions. This transformative period shaped his beliefs and convictions.</p>
            <h2>Parliament of the World’s Religions</h2>
            <p>In 1893, Swami Vivekananda represented India at the Parliament of the World’s Religions in Chicago. His historic speech, beginning with “Sisters and Brothers of America,” captivated the audience and introduced Hinduism and India’s spiritual heritage to the Western world. This event marked a significant step in promoting interfaith dialogue and understanding.</p>
            <h2>Advocate for Religious Tolerance</h2>
            <p>Throughout his life, Swami Vivekananda advocated for religious tolerance and harmony. He believed that all religions lead to the same truth and that respecting each other’s beliefs could bring about global unity. His teachings continue to inspire efforts towards interfaith understanding and peace.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Arise, awake, and stop not until the goal is reached.</li>
            <li>You have to grow from the inside out. None can teach you, none can make you spiritual. There is no other teacher but your own soul.</li>
            <li>In a conflict between the heart and the brain, follow your heart.</li>
            <li>The greatest sin is to think yourself weak.</li>
            <li>Condemn none: if you can stretch out a helping hand, do so. If you cannot, fold your hands, bless your brothers, and let them go their own way.</li>
